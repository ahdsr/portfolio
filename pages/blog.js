                              Fun times editing this one. It was put together
                              last minute to show Brent the kind of quality we
                              can get out of the DJI Phantom Pro. Just like ot
                              looks, a lot off random flying session to string
                              this together but in the end I was happy with it.
                              Happy enough that a few weeks later we went to
                              shoot some ariels for his upcoming special Freaks
                              and Geeks: The Documentary. The Nolan fan that I
                              am, could help myself to throw some score by
                              Zimmerman.
