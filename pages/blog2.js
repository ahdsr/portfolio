              Unfortunately I had to leave early before all the cars

              over top of some of these vehicles were making my

              minute to show Brent the kind of quality we can get
              out of the DJI Phantom Pro. Just like ot looks, a lot
              off random flying session to string this together but
              in the end I was happy with it. Happy enough that a
              few weeks later we went to shoot some ariels for his
              upcoming special Freaks and Geeks: The Documentary.

              some score by Zimmerman.'
