              minute to show Brent the kind of quality we can get
              out of the DJI Phantom Pro. Just like ot looks, a lot
              off random flying session to string this together but
              in the end I was happy with it. Happy enough that a
              few weeks later we went to shoot some ariels for his
              upcoming special Freaks and Geeks: The Documentary.

              some score by Zimmerman.'
