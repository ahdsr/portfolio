                <h2>Interviewing the users</h2>
                <h3>Learning about the queues</h3>
                <p>
                  After conducting some in-depth interviews with the core user
                  group, it was quickly evident that their needs and
                  understanding of what the queue is, was very different. Since
                  the ordering team is broken down into a number of sub-teams,
                  sometimes very granular and specific roles had very unique
                  needs. <span>One thing became clear</span>, the functional
                  inconsistencies between each queue was creating confusion on
                  how users should interact with it, what functions it performed
                  and how to ultimately use it in the most efficient way.

                <h2>Research</h2>

                <p>
                  Once I had a better understanding of what the users needed, I
                  researched out-of-the-box solutions that were already in the
                  wild. At its core the queue is a data table no different from
                  an Excel document (without all the complex features). In fact
                  a lot of users would export data out of the site, and use
                  Excel to further filter the results. In an ideal situation we
                  can leverage and modify one of these existing frameworks but
                  due to technical limitations this was not possible.

                <h2>Planning</h2>
                <h3>Learning about the queues</h3>
                <p>
                  Understanding the feature set and how to improve it was done
                  by sitting down with the main users as well as their leads and
                  managers to understand how each data table is used not only by
                  team members specializing in a specific area of the business,
                  but also with all users that have access to the ordering
                  system. We also had the advantage to review how they use the
                  legacy systems and what actions they perform between the two
                  frameworks. This gave us a great base for comparison to make
                  sure nothing was missed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Keeping track and laying out all the features based on which
                  were working, and which needed fixing was also an important
                  part of the preparation. The example below is a method I used
                  to take notes, and keep track of requirements aside from the
                  officially captured requirements in Confluence and JIRA.
                  Whimsical, aside from being a great planning tool, is also a
                  great note capturing tool especially during quick fire meeting
                  with business. Most of the notes were gathered in the forms of
                  mind maps.

                        One off the key observations and loudest set of feedback
                        from our users was that they wanted to maximize their
                        ability to view more data. This created an interesting
                        design challenge - how do you tightly pack a lot of data
                        onto the screen and still maintain a good level of
                        legibility.

                        Each unique data table presented itself with a
                        challenge. Some functional features are common to all
                        data tables, some needed very custom solutions. A way to
                        solve this was to introduce overflow menus that can be
                        customized based on table and or based on orders within
                        a single table. The original design would expose the
                        actions on the page which made them hard to maintain and
                        wouldn't allow for a scalable solution

                        ability to view more data. The design introduced
                        mechanism for users to hide certain sections away from
                        view. An example of that was filters. Each queue had a
                        specific set of filters that varied in number, by
                        introducing a show/hide feature we were able to maximize

                <h2>Other hurdles</h2>
                <p>
                  Stakeholder availability was intermittent. Reviewing and
                  presenting solutions for a design pattern that affected
                  (everyone) using the Ordering system proved to be logistically
                  very difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Functional prototypes and detailed wires were sent out to
                  circumvent the issue, and meetings when available were very
                  focused for approvals and sign-offs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Big differences of opinion. Not all lines of business worked
                  together, but all lines of business had to use the same
                  application. This revealed that certain component-like
                  solutions just weren’t going to work even though ultimately
                  they would prove to be the most efficient.
