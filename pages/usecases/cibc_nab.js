                    It's easy for travelers to get confused with foreign
                    currency conversion rates. Most travelers are weary of using
                    their banks and credit cards abroad, especially those who
                    don't travel often. This use case explores ways CIBC is

                <p>
                  Who doesn't like to travel? I do, but what I don't like about
                  traveling is brining cash with me. A majority of places I've
                  traveled to support my my bank and credit cards. I haven't had
                  any issues withdrawing money while abroad or used my credit
                  cards in restaurants and shops. The only thing that is still
                  somewhat confusing are foreign currency conversion rates. For
                  one, its easy to get confused with foreign denominations, but
                  also, all the added fees associated with them.

                        what actions they perform between the two frameworks.

                  how do you tightly pack a lot of data onto the screen and

                  Each unique data table presented itself with a challenge. Some
                  functional features are common to all data tables, some needed
                  very custom solutions. A way to solve this was to introduce
                  overflow menus that can be customized based on table and or
                  based on orders within a single table. The original design
                  would expose the actions on the page which made them hard to
                  maintain and wouldn't allow for a scalable solution

                  One off the key observations and loudest set of feedback from
                  our users was that they wanted to maximize their ability to
                  view more data. The design introduced mechanism for users to
                  hide certain sections away from view. An example of that was
                  filters. Each queue had a specific set of filters that varied
                  in number, by introducing a show/hide feature we were able to
                  maximize the screen for max efficiency

                      Stakeholder availability was intermittent. Reviewing and
                      presenting solutions for a design pattern that affected
                      (everyone) using the Ordering system proved to be

                      Big differences of opinion. Not all lines of business
                      worked together, but all lines of business had to use the
                      same application. This revealed that certain
                      component-like solutions just weren’t going to work even
                      though ultimately they would prove to be the most
                      efficient.
